        <p>
           I love building mobile applications.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a lead individual contributor role where I can take on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
       	   software architecture and project management.
